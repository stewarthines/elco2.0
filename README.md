	* Removing movies form now showing or upcoming

2. Draw Nachos Icon

3. Build Pricing Database and pages

4. Set Mobile Background to white (backend)

5. Create Help Videos and Documentation

6. Set Help to navigate to the ID's instead of just the main help page

7. Ajax IN the upcoming and nowshowing Data with Knock out instead of using Sinatra

The movie app attached to this website could easily be used for anyother movie website. It doesn't have to be a drive in. With some tweeking to the front end designs this could easily support any number of movies, screens or theaters. 

It's winning all around.
